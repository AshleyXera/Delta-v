figure out how to not lose the files im working on once theyre properly sorted into this mess of a filetree
    -figure out basic entity structures

potential balance/meta concerns
    -Indoctrinate ability
        -sec finds out theres a Hive aboard and simply mindshields everyone to prevent its growth
        -need to figure if target consent matters (eg. maybe reduce cooldown? bypass mindshield?)

Create .ftl messages file (to maintain localizability)

write up in-game guides for each role
